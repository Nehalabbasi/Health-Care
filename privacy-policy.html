            <dd>ACXSS is committed to providing You with health information, technology and contract management resources. We are also firmly committed to respecting the privacy of Your general and personally identifiable information. ACXSS will not share or sell any personally identifiable information We gather to any company, organization or person outside of ACXSS. Any general personal information You voluntarily provide when using the Site, such as Your name, address, e-mail address as part of the registration process, or credit card information for on-line shopping, will only be used to provide You with information that you specifically request from ACXSS, and for Our internal confidential analysis of aggregate user data, such as computing the total number and regional locations of users. We and the third parties participating in the Site will not use Your general or personally identifiable information without Your prior consent. We will ensure our Website has adequate security procedures in place to protect any information collected from misuse. You can review and correct Your general personal and personally identifiable information at any time; either directly through use of data input screens, or indirectly by submitting a request to the ACXSS Webmaster as described in the last section below, "Questions or Comments." The key exceptions to these privacy protection practices are that information You may provide in live online discussions in chat rooms, or information You may post on bulletin boards, cannot be protected. You should think carefully before disclosing any general personal information or personally identifiable information when using them. When we want to make significant changes to our Privacy Policy that would affect Our use of general or personally identifiable information We collect, We will give notice to You and all users by posting the changes to the Website. We will not make use of information We previously gathered from You prior to a significant change in this Privacy Policy without first obtaining Your consent for any new uses. We may also make non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy that will not affect Our use of Your personally identifiable information. We will post all changes on the Site. You should periodically check this Privacy Policy for updates.</dd>

Some areas of this Site may ask You to submit personally identifiable information in order for You to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, order processing or resume submission) or to participate in a particular activity. You will be informed what information is required and what information is optional. You may always choose not to provide the required information, but then You may not be able to participate in the particular activity that requires the information. Non-personal Information Collection "Non-personal information" means information that does not permit Us to specifically identify You by Your full name or similar unique identifying information such as a Social Security number, member identification number, address or telephone number. In accessing this site, certain non-personal information can be passively collected using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or Web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this Site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the Website You just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version Your computer is currently using. This Site may also collect non-personal information from Your computer through cookies and Internet tags or Web beacons. With respect to collecting Web traffic information, We may use third parties to collect such data on Our behalf. To disable or limit the use of cookies, please refer to the options provided by Your Internet browser. If you do so, however, some pages or features (such as customized products/services or user preferences) on this Website may not work properly. Because non-personal information does not identify who You are, We do not limit the ways We may use or share non-personal information. For example, We may use and combine such non-personal information to provide better service to Site visitors, customize the Site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the Site. We may also share non-personal information with Our parent entities, affiliates, employees and agents, other businesses and the government.
